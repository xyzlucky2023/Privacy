With Apple subscription, the system will deduct the corresponding amount from your App Store account when you confirm your purchase. If the user does not turn off the automatic renewal before the end of the current subscription period (at least 24 hours in advance), the system will deduct the amount automatically at the beginning of the next subscription period. Once the purchase is complete, users can manage their subscriptions and automatic renewals in account Settings. Specific management method: Settings >> click "User Options" >> click "Subscribe", select the corresponding project to modify or cancel.
